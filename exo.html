    <h2>what is web development?</h2>
    <p>Web development is all about creating, building and maintaining websites for the internet and or private networks. Web development is all about coding up a website to give it its functionalities, being different from web design which is more about appearance
    Web development can be back-end, front-end or full stack. The front end focuses on the appearance viewed by the users and their experience while interacting with it.
    The back end is responsible for the code, database and digital architecture by which the site is powered, which includes the API's that helps with the website's functionality.
    Full stack development is a complete combination of both, that is the digital architecture through which the website i sustained at the back end and the user interface which creates user experience
